### Introduction
This project is with respect to the course CO461-Data Warehousing and Data Mining(DWDM). The aim of the project is to carry out the analysis, implementation and reproduce the results of the following research work in the domain of hyperspectral image classification:
[Cascade Superpixel Regularized Gabor Feature
Fusion for Hyperspectral Image Classification](CSRGFF.pdf)

### Overview of the research paper
A 3-D Gabor wavelet provides an effective way to obtain the spectralâ€“spatial-fused features for hyperspectral image, which has shown advantageous performance for material classification and recognition. In this paper, instead of separately employing the Gabor magnitude and phase features, which, respectively, reflect the intensity and variation of surface materials in local area, a cascade superpixel regularized Gabor feature fusion (CSRGFF) approach has been proposed. First, the Gabor filters with particular orientation are utilized to obtain Gabor features (including magnitude and phase) from the original hyperspectral image. Second, a support vector machine (SVM)-based probability representation strategy is developed to fully exploit the decision information in SVM output, and the achieved confidence score can make the following fusion with Gabor phase more effective. Meanwhile, the quadrant bit coding and Hamming distance metric are applied to encode the Gabor phase features and measure sample similarity in sequence. Third, the carefully defined characteristics of two kinds of features are directly combined together without any weighting operation to describe the weight of samples belonging to each class. Finally, a series of superpixel graphs extracted from the raw hyperspectral image with different numbers of superpixels are employed to successively regularize the weighting cube from over-segmentation to under-segmentation, and the classification performance gradually improves with the decrease in the number of superpixels in the regularization procedure. Four widely used real hyperspectral images have been conducted, and the experimental results constantly demonstrate the superiority of the CSRGFF approach over several state-of-the-art methods.

### Project goals
The goals of the project is to analyze, implement and reproduce the results of the proposed method. We try to divide the work into different components and try to analyze and implement each component and them build the entire model. We have identified the following components:

1.) 3D Gabor Filter convolution
2.) Entropy Rate Superpixel Segmentation
3.) SVM based confidence Cube from Magnitude features
4.) Quadrant bit encoding and hamming distance cube from Phase features
5.) Cascading of the weighing cube with the superpixel graphs and carrying out classification

We will try to implement 1-2 features every week with the following schedule described in next section
